Introduction
The Project
Every prospect student knows the struggle of lining up during physical admissions, some students end up fainiting, some giving uip on college admissions, not only are the students affected but also the staffs, who have to work long shifts in order to register and admit all students. 
However, the long queues can be avoided through this college website.

P & R ENGINEERING SCHOOL is a college website! prospect students can browse the courses they need, fee structure and fill the registration form all at the comfort of their home.

Other features include: editing the student's profile, creating a student portal, accessing fee statement, class timetable.

The Context
This project is our Portfolio Project, concluding our Foundations Year at Alx-Africa School. We were able to choose who we wanted to work with and
 what we wanted to work on, as long as we present a working program at the end of the three weeks of development.
